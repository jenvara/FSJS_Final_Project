//Problem: I need a simple to do list to know where I am at with FSJS course syllabus without having to scroll through a syllabus
//Create a syllabus page
	//Build App to-do list for course syllabus
		//Weekly Assignments
		//Checkbox for completion
		//Add button to add extra assignments (add approximate time to complete if possible)
//If I have extra time
	//Timer
		//Countdown timer in hours
		//Subtracts time from each assignment as it's checked completed
